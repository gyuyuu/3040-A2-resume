1. **Title**: 3040-A2-resume
 
2. **Purpose**: Describe the practical steps of how to host and format a resume. 

3. **Prerequisites**: This should include a resume formatted in Markdown (?)

 * Include a link to a good Markdown tutorial under "More Resources." You do not need to explain how to use Markdown. 
 
4. **Instructions, including animated GIF**

 * Use headings and numbered lists
 * Remember to use each step to explain BOTH how to follow Etter's protocol and how to host a resume in GitHub Pages or Codeberg Pages. It's up to you whether you 1) begin with Etter's general process and then demonstrate the process with a practical step involving your resume, or 2) begin with the practical steps for hosting a resume and relate each practical step to a concept in Etter's book.
 * Add an animated GIF:
