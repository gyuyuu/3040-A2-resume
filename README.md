   1. Why is Markdown better than a word processor?: Markdown is simple and easier to use than a word processor. Also it can easily write source codes.
   2. Why is my resume not showing up?: When you are hosting your github page for the first time, you maybe should wait for several minutes until it compeletely be processed. If it still not showing up, then check your repository title. It should be your username.github.io.
